<center><h3><u>ROAD OBJECT DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING</h3></center>

*Steps to install Road Objection Detection using deep learning*

<ul>
<li>Make sure Git is installed in your computer. You can get Git from this link <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a>
<li>Open git bash to your desired location
<li>Do git clone <code>https://github.com/JokerBroker/intelrepo.git</code>
<li>cd into yolov5
<li>Do <code>pip install â€“r requirements.txt</code>. This will install all the required packages and libraries.
</ul>
With this the setting up of the project is done. Now we set up the database. 
<h3><u>Database</h3>
The database we used is the idd-lite database created by IIT Hyderabad.   
It can be downloaded from this link :-<a href="https://idd.insaan.iiit.ac.in/dataset/download/">https://idd.insaan.iiit.ac.in/dataset/download/</a>. It is available in our dataset as well. The database consists of three folders. <code>train</code>,<code>valid</code> and <code>test</code>.  <code>train</code> contains 3700 pictures. Annotations for each picture were generated by putting each picture through  <a href="https://roboflow.com/">https://roboflow.com/</a>. After generating all the bounding box for each picture database folder is created and the pictures are put in images and annotations are put in labels. There are 15 classes <code>'animal', 'autorickshaw', 'bicycle', 'bus', 'car', 'caravan', 'motorcycle', 'person', 'rider', 'traffic light', 'traffic sign', 'trailer', 'train', 'truck', 'vehicle fallback'</code>.  

<h3><u>Training</u></h3>

We need to train the model using the dataset we obtained in the previous step. Run the following command to train the model with the dataset:
<code> py train.py --img 640 --epochs 40 --data data.yaml  --weights yolov5s.pt</code>

After executing the training command the following path will be obtained in the terminal. 
<code>Optimizer stripped from runs/train/yolov5l_results2/weights/last.pt, 93.8MB Optimizer stripped from runs/train/yolov5l_results2/weights/best.pt, 93.8MB</code>.

<code>runs/train/yolov5l_results2/weights/best.pt</code> will be the location for the model.

<h3><u>Detecting</u></h3>
Now after training, validation and testing we are ready to detect for objects in videos and images. Use the below command for detecting objects in images and videos. 

<code>py detect.py --weights runs\train\exp3\weights\best.pt --conf 0.6 --source data/images/"name of the input file"   </code>

We will get the result in :-<code>models\yolov5\runs\detect\exp</code> 

Sample Input :- <code> models\yolov5\data\images\dashcam.mp4 </code>
Sample Output :- <code>models\yolov5\runs\detect\exp2\dashcam.mp4</code>
